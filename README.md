# Quantitative_Evaluation_of_Tomasulo_Based_Microarchitectures
A C++ simulator that models three versions of Tomasulo's Algorithm. Model A does Dynamic Scheduling, Model B has dynamic scheduling, RoB but no Speculation and Model C has both along with  a single bit naive branch predictor. So both Model A and B stall on branches but Model B provides precise exceptions.
